# Welcome! These are my dotfiles.

**What are dotfiles?**\
A portable repository that you can use to bring your files on the go, that usually start with '.' (hence the name).

**A note about mine**\
I am not making this for everyone, and this is for my personal use only, but feel free to try them out!

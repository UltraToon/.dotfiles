# My Dotfiles

## Welcome
Hello, these are my **dotfiles**, basically files I use to-go throughout my awesome GNU/Linux adventure.

## Dependencies
**Git** - _Obviously..._\n
**Bash** - _Needed for my awesome bash configuration_\n
**Coreutils** - **_ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY!_**\n

# Notice!
_I customize these to my own personal liking, so please change it to your own favor if you dislike some things about this._
